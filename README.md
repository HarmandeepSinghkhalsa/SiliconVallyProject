# Hospital Information
Project Idea Submitted For Silicon Valley

Disclaimer : The data shown is dummy data, for demonstration purposes only.

The idea is to display data of various hospitals near current location of the user.
The data can be fetched from a pre-populated database with information about the hospitals.
It will help the user to find nearest hospitals with information about availability of bed, oxygen cylinders, ventilators etc.
The information will be shown on google map so that the user can quickly locate & contact the required hospital.
It will be extremely useful in the current pandemic situation.
The code cannot be submitted due to use of personal google API, can be demonstrated (as shown in screenshot) if the project is selected for Silicon Valley.
